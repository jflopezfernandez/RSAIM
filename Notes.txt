Thoughts for Future

***Encryption***
Server has a list of clients. The server, or at least the Client handler, should hold the client's public key
On connection, the client should send its public key.

From then on the server should encrypt all messages sent to the client and the client decrypt all incoming messages
Does the server have its own public/private keypair? Would make it so that no unencrypted messages (other than public keys) are 
sent. But does it slow things down too much? I'm inclined to give the server its own key pair

Does the client get access to everyone's public key or only get the public key for someone when they want to send them a message? 
They probably need to have everyone's key in order to be able to send something like "pm UserA EncryptedMessage."
Otherwise,it should be "pm UserA" Recieve KeyA "send EncryptedMessage." Second option takes less memory on the client side but it probably a bit more complicated to handle. Currently, messages sent are independent of one another. This second method would make the second message dependant on the first. So I'm leaning option one.

Encryption/Decryption Steps:
MessageOriginator MessageRecipient Steps
Server            UserA            Server encrypts using PubKeyA; User decrypts using PrivKeyA
UserA             Server           UserA encrypts using PubKeyS; Server decrypts using PrivKeyS
UserA             UserB            UserA encrypts using PubKeyB, then encrypts using PubKeyS;
                                   Server decrypts using PrivKeyS, then encrypts using PubKeyB
                                   UserB decrypts using PrivKeyB, UserB decrypts using PrivKeyB

***Server Commands***
What commands should the server accept and execute?

Exit: Shuts down all client connection then closes the socket. Implemented (edit to Shutdown?)
Admin [user]: makes [user] an adminstrator who can send the server commands through their client
Kick [user]: disconnects [user]
???

***User commands***
Help: Help menu
Exit: close connection
PM [USER]: Send private message to [user]
All: Send message to all
  This is probably complicated using RSA because each recipient needs to get their own personally encrypted message. For now, maybe 
  this is sent for the server to read and then encrypted for each user? Or the client-end sends "pm [User] EncryptedMessage" for 
  each user on the server (excluding self)
